
HERE IS MY OWN: http://generator.voucherify.io/

I am using firefox version 55.0 and imacros version 9.0.3. It is likely NOT TO work for you if you have different version!



1, Go to http://generator.voucherify.io/

2, Click on "Advanced options..."

3, Set amount of codes to whatever you want, but there might be a limit for 10k codes (my checker can do max 99999 at a time)

4, Set Single code length to 15

5, Set character set to "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"

6, Leave code prefix and code postfix blank

7, Set character set to "####-######-#####"

8, If you have copied everything, paste them into a new sheet at sheets.google.com (so it will paste everything under each other)
9, Now copy those from top to bottom and paste them into.. Check my checker thread for more info if you want to check the cards. Please note that it's about a 1 in a million chance that the code will work.
